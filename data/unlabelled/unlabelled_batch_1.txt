Fortunately, he improved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high flow supplemental oxygen
He did not require any intubations
He was transferred back to the general medical floor once he was more hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95% consistently.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Per Dr
Name  NI  1369  note  The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of lymphoma diagnosed in  2122  for which he received radiation therapy and CHOP
He developed paralysis of the left leg due to radiation in  2124  and has been dependent on a brace and crutches
He developed radiation colitis with periodic rectal bleeding and incontinence of stool and urine in  2127 
He developed recurrent lymphoma in the porta hepatis and was treated with radiation therapy in  2144-9-16 
He also received CHOP and RICE
He developed a biliary stricture and common hepatic duct obstruction and underwent ERCP and stent placement in  2144-8-17  and  2145-6-17 
Those stents were removed
In  2148-1-18 , he presented with fever and elevated LFTs
He had an ERCP at that time and was subsequently referred to  Hospital1 18  where he underwent an ERCP on  2-8 
This demonstrated the presence of an existing plastic stent that was blocked with sludge and was removed
He had small stone fragments and pus that were seen extruding from the common duct once the stent was removed
There was a long benign-appearing stricture of the common bile duct and common hepatic duct with dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts proximally
Cytology was negative
Since then, he has undergone several follow-up ERCPs and dilatation
He has also undergone repeated brushings for cytology that have all been benign
Because of recurrent stricture that has been unresponsive to endoscopic dilatation, he was referred for consideration of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy
We have discussed the indications for surgical repair, the surgical procedure itself, risks, potential complications, postoperative recovery, follow-up, and outcomes
The patient has provided informed consent and is brought to the operating room for cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of IV drug abuse, who initially presented to an outside hospital on  2143-3-2  from a drug and detoxification facility with a chief complaint of headache, abdominal pain, and fever
At the outside hospital, the patient was found to be febrile to 104.6 degrees F, and she subsequently developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s
During this initial evaluation, the patient was confused and only intermittently answering questions
There was concern for possible headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia, so given the concern for meningitis, a spinal tap was done
This study demonstrated 50 white blood cells  84% neutrophils , 10 red blood cells, protein of 23, glucose of 86, and 0-5 yeast per high power field
Given these findings and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside hospital
Given the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds at the outside hospital, the patient was therefore transferred to the  Hospital1 69  for further evaluation
On arrival to the Emergency Department at the  Hospital1 346 , the patient was found to have icteric sclerae, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, abdominal guarding, and right upper quadrant tenderness
Given the concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside hospital
In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal dilatation
Also at this time, the patient began to deny the report that she was HIV positive; this report has been obtained only by report and not by documented laboratory testing from the outside hospital.
