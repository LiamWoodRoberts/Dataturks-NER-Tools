HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr
Known lastname 3311  is a 68 yo man with a history of severe CAD s/p MI, 3V CABG  LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, sequential SVG-D1-OM  in  2169  and multiple PCIs who presents with acute onset chest pain
The patient states that he was in his usual state of health when he woke up this morning  10-2 
He was in his kitchen when the next thing he knew he woke up on the floor
He denies any prodrome including dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, focal weakness, or aura
He does not know how long he was unconscious, but when he awoke he was experiencing acute onset  10-8  retrosternal chest pain
The pain was diffuse and located at the midline
It was not positional and was not acutely associated with nausea or vomiting
It did radiate up to his jaw, which alarmed him since this was exactly what he experienced when he had his MI
He does not think he fell on his chest
He was able to get up on his own, climb the stairs, and call EMS
He was brought to  Hospital3   where he was given ASA and nitro SL without relief of his chest pain
He was started on a TNG drip but still complained of  10-8  pain
EKG showed ventricularly paced rhythm with no acute ST or QRS changes from prior
A Troponin-I measurment was 0.14
Myoglobin was 103
His INR was 4.3
An ABG on 2L NC at that time was 7.32/46/95/24/Sat 97%
He was subsequently transferred to  Hospital1 18  for possible catheterization
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors
He is unable to walk very far due to left leg pain, but states this is due to an established neuropathy
All of the other review of systems were negative
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr
Known lastname 3315  is a 76 year old male with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation  and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented to outside hospital with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for the last six months
He admits to occasional rest pain as well
During that admission, he was found to be anemic and transfused with several units of PRBC's
Endoscopy found a nonbleeding AV malformation in the proximal duodenum
Given his above cardiac status, he was transferred to the  Hospital1 18  for further evaluation and treatment.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 81y/o M with h/o diverticular bleed presented to ED with melena and BRBPR x1 day
Pt felt lightheaded, but denied CP, palpitations, or dyspnea at rest
+ DOE
Denied N/V
Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on ED exam
Hct had dropped from 41.9 in  7-14  to 33.7
NG lavage was performed, which revealed active bleeding that did not clear - 1000cc lavage was performed
Pt was noted to have ST depressions in V2-V3 and elevated troponin to 0.15
Pt was transfused 5 units PRBCs
EGD revealed esophageal varices and active bleeding
Banding was attempted but unsuccessful
Profuse bleeding was noted during EGD, and pt had episodes of frank hematemesis
He was therefore intubated and sedated
In the  Name  NI   , pt rec'd 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP  INR 2.9 on presentation 
He also rec'd protonix 40mg IV x1, sandestatin 200mcg IV x1, levofloxacin 500mg IV x1, propofol gtt, succinylcholine/etomidate, vitamin K sc, and octreotide gtt
He was given a total of 6 units FFP, as well, as well as a bag of platelets, and taken to IR for emergent TIPS
At IR, pt was noted to have small systemic-portal pressure gradient  10mm Hg , with elevated Pra  25mm Hg  and portal pressures of 35mm Hg
Varices did not fill with injection of dye into the portal vein
TIPS was not performed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Dr
Known lastname 3339  is a 60 yoM with a history of myxomatous mitral valve disease s/p annuloplasty ' 98 , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation currently on Dronedarone and Coumadin, h/o postoperative NSVT s/p ICD placement, and h/o nondilated cardiomyopathy with EF  who presents with lightheadedness and near-syncope in the context of recent undefined illness and weight loss
Pt reports history of 25lb weight loss in the past 6 weeks that he attributes to losing his sense of taste due to his Parkinson's meds
He denies any further focal symptoms during this time frame
Then, today he was not feeling well while at work in the ED here at  Hospital1 18 
He had been feeling lightheaded all day
He went home then relates that he was laying on the couch watching TV with his daughter and may have passed out for some time, the only thing he remembers is his daughter waking him up
He is unsure if he actually lost consciousness or not
A family member took his pulse and found him to be in the 20's, so brought him to the ED
There his vitals were hr 31, 110/68, 18, 100% RA
He was found to have elevated INR, hypokalemic and repleted
EKG showing sinus bradycardia with intermittent ventricular escape beats and Vpaced beats
He is admitted to CCU for pacer interrogation and monitoring
ROS is positive as above and also with worsening postural hypoTN, which he ascribes to the Parkinson's meds, and lost of taste, also attributed to Parkinson's meds 
ROS is negative for f/c/ns, CP, SOB, diaphoresis, cough, PND, orthopnea, syncope
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 78 year-old male admitted earlier then anticipated, because of failure to thrive, respiratory difficulties, peripheral edema and pericardial effusion after having been discharged for a prior hospitalization for aspiration pneumonia where he was found to have a collapse of his left main stem bronchus, distal trachea and right main stem bronchus for which he subsequently had a stent placed during that previous visit
He returned on  4-23  of  2195  earlier then anticipated as mentioned previously for removal of these stents and tracheoplasty and pericardiotomy for intraoperative pericardiotomy for pericardial effusion that he developed
At the time of his admission the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 150/80, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20 and he was sating 95% on room air
Notably on examination his cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm
The lungs revealed bilateral crackles throughout and there was 1 to 2+ pitting edema most markedly notable in the lower extremities
On admission his electrolytes were all within normal limits with a BUN and creatinine of 18 and 1.0
His white blood cell count was 4.4
Hematocrit 37.5 and platelet count was 131
PT was 13.7, INR 1.2 and PTT was 59.4
The patient was admitted and had his stents removed on  4-28 
He subsequently underwent a number of bronchoscopies for clearing of secretions
He was optimized preoperatively for surgery
On  4-30  he underwent right thoracotomy with posterior membrane tracheoplasty and bilateral bronchoplasties along with pericardial window
The surgery went smoothly without complications, but due to the patient's size and anatomy the distal portion of the left main stem bronchus could not be corrected, therefore some tracheomalacia remained at that edge
Initially postoperatively, the patient's course went fairly smoothly
Several days postoperatively the patient developed acute renal failure for which his creatinine jumped to 3.5 and this was found to be partially due to acute tubular necrosis and hypovolemia
The patient remained in and out of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of his hospitalization
One week postoperatively the patient went into pulmonary congestion and subsequent respiratory arrest at which time he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but was subsequently extubated with aggressive diuresis and aggressive antimicrobial therapy
The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit after his tracheal bronchitis had cleared and he subsequently went back to the floor
While on the floor the patient developed severe pneumonia, which required him to return to the Intensive Care Unit
Again with aggressive care and antimicrobial therapy he regained enough strength to return to the floor
After discharge to the floor toward the end of his hospitalization he did well for two weeks
He did have repeat bronchoscopies, which showed the distal tracheal malacia as previously mentioned, but there was excellent clearance of secretions throughout
It is anticipated that as his airway edema resolves his clearance will become even more improved
Of note, late in his hospital course the patient developed recurrent right pleural effusions with some loculations, but the majority of this was cleared with placement of a chest tube.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Fifty-five year old with male with end-stage renal disease who is hemodialysis dependent, who at dialysis session aborted midway on  Last Name  LF  2974 ,  2154-7-12  because he developed chest pain midway through dialysis
Per his wife, he has had very frequent episodes of chest pain more than 10 during dialysis since he was started on hemodialysis in  2153-8-16 
He went to a hospital in  Hospital1 392 , where he was started on nitrodrip
His chest pain resolved and has not returned since, and he went home the next day
His wife noted that the workup for his chest pain has been negative in the past including a cardiac catheterization done in  2153-9-16  which showed normal coronary arteries
Since the night prior to admission, he has had cough
No fevers, no chills
He missed dialysis today,  7-15  because he was sent to the Emergency Department from home shortly before he was scheduled for his 5 pm dialysis
He denies any changes in his diet or noncompliance with dietary restrictions
He has been unable to lie flat this past day due to shortness of breath
This is new compared with his baseline
He does not complain of shortness of breath at rest currently, and says that he is able to work, but that his exercise tolerance is markedly decreased compared with his baseline

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Age over 90  yo man with h/o Parkinson's disease, multiple prior admissions for aspiration pneumonia most recently  2142-4-23 , who presents again from  Hospital 100  Rehab after the staff there had "trouble waking him up" this AM, and found him to be in mixed respiratory failure
On the prior admit, the pt was diagnosed with a LLL pna and treated with vancomycin/zosyn
Per his wife, the patient was doing relatively well last week, still in the MACU at  Hospital 100  Rehab since his recent discharge from  Hospital1 18  but with a plan to transition to the regular floor soon
His ABG on  2142-5-16  was 7.34/69/55 on room air, which is close to his baseline pCO2
On Saturday 2d PTA, the pt's wife noted that he was congested more than baseline, initially unable to cough, but then improved after neb treatments with the production of brown-pink secretions
He had hyperglycemia to FS 223, which per wife he has never had before  no h/o DM

ABG performed, 7.20/107/44, O2 sat 68% on ABG, presumably on room air though unclear
BIPAP was written for  IPAP 16, EPAP 3 , though it is not clear if this was started
He was shortly thereafter intubated after the Pulmonologist confirmed his Full Code status with the pt's wife
After intubation, it was noted that he had copious thick yellow secretions in his trachea, which were felt to be the culprit causing obstruction and hypercarbia/hypoxemia
With suctioning his breathing improved, and he was transferred to  Hospital1 18  for further work up

His CXR was concerning to the ED staff for RUL/RLL processes  though appears to have only persistent LLL , and he was given CTX, Vanc, and Flagyl out of concern for nosocomial vs
aspiration pna
His urine was leuk esterase  +  on UA, culture pending
Blood cultures were also sent
He received 1L NS for hypotension, and subsequently his pressures were still low so he was started on a dopamine drip via a newly-placed RIJ  per report, sterile placement via ultrasound in the ER 
He also had a 18G PIV placed, and has a PICC line from  Hospital   Rehab that is of unclear age or indication  felt to be from prior need for IV abx
